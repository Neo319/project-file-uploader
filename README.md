# Description

This is a personal portfolio project built as a monorepo. It is a solution to the ['File Uploader' project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-file-uploader) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. This project aims to create a stripped-down version of a cloud storage service like Google Drive.

It is primarily intended to practice the use of Prisma ORM for database management. Rather than relying on rqw PostgreSQL queries for database operation, prisma is employed to streamline and simplify the app's relation with the database.

## Deployment

This project does not currently feature a live deployement. This remains a work in progress.

## Usage

The project's purpose is for users to upload files to a local or remote database -- whether images, text files, or other formats -- and use prisma ORM to manage the data -- using buffers for images, for example.

Core purpose:

- utilize prisma ORM to manage a more complex database.
- Use passport.js for authentication.

## Technologies used

- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM
- Javascript, HTML
